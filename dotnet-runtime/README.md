# .NET Runtime 

This ROCK is a tiny [Chiseled](https://github.com/canonical/chisel) Ubuntu container image, containing the [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) runtimes and libraries necessary 
for running .NET applications in production.

# Dependencies

This image relies on the `dotnet-runtime-deps` ROCK, which is built and maintained separately.
