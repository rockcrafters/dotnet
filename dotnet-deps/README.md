# .NET Runtime Deps

This image is a tiny [Chiseled](https://github.com/canonical/chisel) Ubuntu container image, containing a set of native [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) dependencies
and basic configurations, which are just enough for running [self-contained](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/) .NET applications.
